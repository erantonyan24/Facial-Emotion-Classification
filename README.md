# Emotion Detection (FER-2013) – CNN-Based Model

A convolutional neural network (CNN) model implemented in **Keras** to detect and classify facial expressions using the **Emotion Detection (FER-2013)** dataset.

---

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Kaggle dataset by *ananthu017*, containing **48×48 grayscale facial images** labeled across seven emotion categories :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
- **Total Samples**: Approximately **35,685 images**, divided into training and testing sets :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- **Emotion Classes**: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
